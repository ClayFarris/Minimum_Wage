Minimum Wage and Happiness



This project compares the average yearly minimum wage from the years 2015 - 2018 for 31 contries with the average level of happiness for those same countries as reported by the World Happiness Report for the years 2015-2018.

The amount of money a person makes has traditionally been associated with their capacity for being happy in most parts of the world. A minimum wage is the lowest renumeration that employers can legally pay their workers--the price floor below which workers may not sell their labor. Most countries had introduced minimum wage legislation by the end of the 20th century.

I would like to explore how the average minimum wage for a country during the years 2015-2018 compares to its average happiness score during those same years.

Question:
* Do countries with a relatively higher minimum wage correlate significantly with countries that have higher happiness scores?
